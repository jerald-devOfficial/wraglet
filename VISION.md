# Wraglet: Vision & Roadmap

## Our Vision

Wraglet aims to be a transformative social platform that prioritizes authentic connections, factual information, and meaningful engagement. We envision a digital space where:

- **Authenticity trumps anonymity**
- **Quality content outweighs quantity**
- **Community standards are upheld through verification and moderation**
- **Diverse content formats serve different communication needs**
- **Real-time interactions foster genuine engagement**

## Core Platform Principles

### 1. Verified Identity

Unlike other platforms that permit anonymous accounts, Wraglet will implement a robust verification process to ensure each user is:

- A real person with a verifiable identity
- Unique within the platform (no duplicate accounts)
- Accountable for their contributions and interactions

This foundation of trust will make Wraglet suitable for:

- Educational institutions
- Government agencies
- Professional communities
- Family networks
- Any group valuing authentic interactions

### 2. Content Integrity

Wraglet will actively combat misinformation through:

- Source credibility assessment for shared links
- Fact-checking integration for trending topics
- Content moderation focusing on accuracy, not just acceptability
- Transparency in content ranking algorithms
- Penalties for repeatedly sharing false information

### 3. Format-Appropriate Content

Different types of communication require different formats:

- **Short Posts** (≤800 characters): For quick updates, thoughts, and engagement
- **Blog Posts**: For in-depth analysis, stories, and longer-form content
- **Videos**: For visual communication and experiences
- **Events**: For organizing real-world and virtual gatherings
- **Gaming-Intercom**: For real-time audio communication during gaming sessions
- **Live Streaming**: For broadcasting experiences to your network
